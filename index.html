					<h2 id="black">The Problem: </h2>
					<p>The website for Loving County, Texas, which provides essential resources to residents and visitors has significant usability and accessability issues. The site fails in providing users with a convenient or intuitive way of accessing its information.</p>
					<h2 id="black">Constraints: </h2>
					<p>This project had a very short timeline (~14 days for design and development). As a result, there was no user/usability testing and little iteration. I used low-fi and hi-fi prototypes to 'eyeball' which designs worked better, but if I were to fully launch the site, I would take a far more iterative approach. Additionally, this was one of my first development projects, so there is one minor accessability issue in that the font-sizes don't adjust to user browser size setting, which I would also address in a full launch.</p>

								<h3>Low-Fi Prototypes</h3>
								<p>I tried addressing the main usability problems with the site by trying to establish a clear heirarchy in my low-fi prototypes. I made balsamiq wireframes of the three screen sizes to show the page's responsive elements.</p>

							<h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
							<p>I created a UI Style guide to both inform high-fi prototyping, and allow others to recreate the site or elements of it.</p>

						<div class="image" id="zoomB"><img src="hi-fi.png" alt="" /></div>

							<h3>Hi-Fi Prototypes (1/2)</h3>
							<p>I used Figma to translate my wireframes into high fidelity prototypes. Notably, while working on the design, I chose to switch from seperate icon bars upon expansion to singular, larger ones. I felt this better maintained a clear heirarchy on smaller screens. </p>
